Some people are afraid to bring their workloads to the cloud because they're afraid they'll get locked into a particular vendor. But in lots of ways, Google gives customers the ability to run their applications elsewhere, if Google becomes no longer the best provider for their needs. Here are some examples of how Google helps its customers avoid feeling locked in. GCP services are compatible with open source products. For example, take Cloud Bigtable, a database we'll discuss later. Bigtable uses the interface of the open source database Apache HBase, which gives customers the benefit of code portability. Another example, Cloud Dataproc offers the open source big data environment Hadoop, as a managed service. Google publishes key elements of technology using open source licenses to create ecosystems that provide customers with options other than Google. For example, TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine learning developed inside Google, is at the heart of a strong open source ecosystem. Many GCP technologies provide interoperability. Kubernetes gives customers the ability to mix and match microservices running across different clouds, and Google Stackdriver lets customers monitor workload across multiple cloud providers.
