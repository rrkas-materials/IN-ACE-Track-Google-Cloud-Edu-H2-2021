## Cloud Computing Services

*Question 1*

**Does a cloud computing service let you scale your resource use up and down?**

Yes

Correct

That is correct. The cloud provider has a pool of resources and lets you use more or less on demand.

*Question 2*

**To get resources from a cloud computing provider, is working with a person at the provider required?**

No

Correct

That is correct.  Cloud computing resources are available on-demand and self-service. (An exception: cloud computing providers typically set some limits on the amount of resources a customer can consume by default, to help customers avoid accidental runaway resource usage and charges. These limits can be raised by the cloud provider.)
