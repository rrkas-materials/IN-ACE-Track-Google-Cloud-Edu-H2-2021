According to some estimates out there publicly, Google's network carries as much as 40 percent of the world's Internet traffic every day. Google's network is the largest of its kind on earth and the company has invested billions of dollars over the years to build it. It's designed to give its users the highest possible throughput and the lowest possible latencies for their applications. The network interconnects at more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 points of presence worldwide. When an Internet user sends traffic to a Google resource, Google responds to the user's request from an edge network location that will provide the lowest latency. Google's Edge-caching network sites content close to end users to minimize latency.
