You're probably thinking,
how can I make sure I don't accidentally run
up a big GCP bill? GCP provides four tools to
help: budgets and alerts, billing, export,
reports and quotas. Let's look at budgets
and alerts first. You can define budgets either per billing account or
per GCP project. A budget can be a fixed limit or you can tie it
to another metric. For example, a percentage of
the previous month spend. To be notified when costs approach your budget
limit, create an alert. For example, with
a budget limit of $20,000 and an alert
set at 90 percent, you'll receive
a notification alert when your expenses reach $18,000. Alerts are generally
set at 50 percent, 90 percent, and 100 percent. But you can customize that. Billing export lets you store detailed
billing information in places where it's easy to retrieve for
more detailed analysis, such as a BigQuery dataset
or a Cloud storage bucket. Reports is a visual tool in the GCP console that allows you to monitor
your expenditure. GCP also implements quotas, which protect both account owners and the GCP community as a whole. Quotas are designed to prevent the over-consumption
of resources, whether because of error
or malicious attack. There are two types
of quotas: rate quotas and allocation quotas. Both get applied at the level
of the GCP project. Rate quotas reset
after a specific time. For example, by default, the Kubernetes Engine service sets a quota of a 1000 calls to its API from each GCP project
every 100 seconds. After that 100 seconds, the limit is reset. Allocation quotas,
on the other hand, govern the number of resources you can have
in your projects. For example, by default, each GCP project has
a quota allowing it no more than five Virtual
Private Cloud networks. Although projects all start
with the same quotas, you can change some
of them by requesting an increase from
Google Cloud support.
