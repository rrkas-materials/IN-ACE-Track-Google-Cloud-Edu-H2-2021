The virtual world is built on physical infrastructure, and all those racks of humming servers use vast amounts of energy. Together, all existing data centers use roughly two percent of the world's electricity, so Google works to make data centers run as efficiently as possible. Google's data centers were the first to achieve ISO 14001 certification, which is a standard that maps out a framework for improving resource efficiency and reducing waste. This is Google's data center in Hamina, Finland, one of the most advanced and efficient data centers in the Google fleet. Its cooling system uses seawater from the bay of Finland to reduce energy use. It's the first of its kind anywhere in the world. Google is one of the world's largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy. Google has been a hundred percent carbon neutral since 2007, and will shortly reach a hundred percent renewable energy sources for its data centers. Just like its customers, Google is trying to do the right things for the planet. GCP customers have environmental goals of their own, and running their workloads in GCP can be a part of meeting them.
